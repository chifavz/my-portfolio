                <p>
                    Hello! I'm <strong>Chifavz</strong>, a passionate and results-driven full stack engineer 
                    based in Dallas, TX. I specialize in building <strong>MVP products</strong> from the ground up, 
                    helping ideas come to life with seamless user experiences and scalable backend systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in tech started with a fascination for turning ideas into interactive and 
                    user-friendly applications. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in 
                    <strong> frontend, backend, and database development</strong>, giving me the ability to take 
                    projects from concept to deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What sets me apart is my ability to deliver <strong>end-to-end solutions</strong>—from 
                    intuitive interfaces and optimized APIs to reliable data models. I thrive on challenges, 
                    adapt quickly, and always stay updated with the latest tools and frameworks to build 
                    cutting-edge solutions.
                </p>
