# Internal Blog System Setup

The portfolio now features a dynamic internal blog system that uses markdown for content management, specifically designed for affiliate marketing content.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: All blog posts are written in markdown format for easy content creation
- **Affiliate Marketing Focus**: Built-in affiliate disclaimers and marketing-focused content structure
- **Responsive Design**: Blog posts look great on all devices
- **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Clean URL structure for better search engine optimization
- **Category Organization**: Posts are organized by categories (Tools & Resources, React, Hosting, etc.)

## How It Works

- The blog is now fully internal - no external redirects
- Blog posts are stored as JavaScript objects with markdown content
- React Router handles navigation between blog list and individual posts
- ReactMarkdown component renders the markdown content
- Automatic affiliate disclosure on all posts

## Adding New Blog Posts

To add a new blog post, edit `/src/components/BlogLayout.js` and add a new object to the `blogPosts` array:

```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  title: 'Your New Blog Post Title',
  slug: 'your-new-blog-post-slug',
  excerpt: 'A brief description of your post...',
  date: '2024-01-20',
  author: 'Chifavz',
  category: 'Your Category',
  readTime: '5 min read',
  content: `# Your Blog Post Title

Your markdown content goes here...

Remember to include affiliate disclosures where appropriate.`
}
```
